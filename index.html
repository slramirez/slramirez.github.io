          <h2><a name="Bio"><strong>Bio</strong></a></h2>
	  
	  <p>I am a political scientist specializing in advanced quantitative methodology, econometrics, and game theory. 
 		I aim for impactful theory and data-driven insights using a variety of tools. I am interested in opportunities 
		to take on complex challenges and provide solutions in a collaborative, fast-paced, and goal-oriented environment. 
	      <ul>
  		<li>I create mathematical and game theoretic models to analyze and predict strategic behavior. 
			<!--For example, how secrecy makes bargaining more efficient, how mediators 
			can be more effective, and how to stop terror financing.--> 
		      </li>
  		<li>I leverage structured and unstructured data (event, panel, longitudinal, text, networks, and GIS) 
			to evaluate predictions and test hypotheses.</li>
  		<li>I deploy advanced quantitative methods, econometrics/statistics, experiments, data mining, analysis, 
			visualization, and interpretation to create powerful data-driven results. </li>
		<li>I communicate complex techniques and analyses to diverse audiences (radio, TV, conferences, 
			classrooms, peer-reviewed journals).</li>
		<li>I teach courses and workshops on econometrics, statistics, game theory, causal inference, 
			survey/lab/field experiments, and political science.</li>
		<li>R (10+ yrs), Python (2+ yrs), Stata (9+ yrs), Qualtrics (5+ yrs), NLP</li>

	  <h3> The effectiveness of mediators </h3> 
	      <p> <ul>
  			<li>I generate predictions about the effect of mediation on strategic bargaining by creating a game theoretic model.</li> 
		      	<li>I evaluate the predictions using a case study of the U.S. and North Korean nuclear crisis.</li> 
		      	<li>I provide recommendations to improve mediation, the development of political institutions, 
		      	and conflict resolution between dictatorships and democracies.</li>
	          </ul>

		      <!--Mediators -- who use secrecy and agenda-setting -- can reduce conflict by making incremental proposals 
	              that winnow away less resolved adversaries. In doing so, mediators can also lock in longer-term 
	    	      agreements with additional terms that concern the general public, but are not on the agenda (i.e., 
	              water, environmental, or justice provisions).-->

	<h3> Leveraging observable attacks to reveal hidden terrorist motives </h3>
	 
	         <p> <ul>
  			<li>We construct a classifcation scheme to differentiate terrorist affiliates conceptually and empirically.</li> 
		      	<li>We use clustering and regression analyses and find that targets and tactics 
			aid in identifying latent terrorist types, and tracking their allegiances over time.</li> 
	  		<li>We find evidence of a global-parochial divide: most Al Qaeda's network is focused on civil conflicts, 
	        	with fewer than 12% targeting the West or using attacks that are likely to reach global audiences.</li>
	  	</ul> 
	  	<br> <br> 
		<img src="aqascoreplot2.png" width=48% alt="The classification scheme at work. Only three groups (top-right) consistently target the West with propaganda-generating suicide attacks. A majority of affiliates are launching civil campaigns against their home state governments (left).">

	<h3> Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Violence in the Isreali-Palestinian Conflict </h3>
	        <p> <ul>
  			<li>I use multidimensional Hawkes process models to explore the spatial and temporal diffusion of violence.</li> 
		      	<li>I analyze micro-level data collected from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/en/21126/">weekly reports</a>.</li> 
	  		<li>I find little evidence of temporal excitation, and stronger evidence of spatial excitation effects. 
				Much of the violence can be explained by the spatial diffusion of attacks by civilians, 
				while controlling for the weapon type and severity.</li> 
			<li>My results suggest that policymakers might better reduce violence by addressing neighborhoods
			of support for civilian-led retaliation.</li>

	<h3> Identifying hierarchies in terrorist networks with minimal information </h3>
	 	
	        <p> Due to the covert nature of terrorism, a group's leadership, cells, and structure are
			inherently difficult to identify. 
		<ul>	<li>We use graph theory to show how the direction of terrorist communications can reveal sets
			of mutual influence and a network's latent hierarchical structure.</li> 
			<li>We analyze the 9/11 hijacker network and a larger network of 
				62 terrorists.</li>
			<li>Our analysis show how our method aids in uncovering hierarchies, cell leaders, and types of
				operatives. </li>

          <h3>International Diplomacy Project</h3>
          <p> I am collecting data using student-powered simulations to explore how multilateral negotiations and diplomacy works. The simulations have been run annually since 2013, and has expanded to include participants from Georgia Tech, Morehouse College, Spelman College, Agnes Scott, and Kennesaw State University.    
<br><br>
As a research endeavor, I designed the project to use real world data, new technology to track participants (RFID tokens), and social media to track dialogue. This research takes the first step in identifying the value of face-time, secrecy, mediation, and bilateral talks in simulating diplomacy. <br><br> Additional resources can be found here: <a href="idp.html"><strong>Project Website</strong></a>.</p>
