<p> My research uses game theory, statistical methods, experiments, surveys, and field work to improve understanding of negotiations, terrorism, and leaders. </p>

	  <h3> How do mediators make a difference? </h3> 
	      <p> Political leaders often face domestic constraints that limit their abilities to negotiate.
		  One hypothesis is that mediators who use secrecy and agenda-setting might make a difference. <br><br> 
		  I use game theory to prove how a mediator changes negotiations by "probing the bargaining space" 
		  -- proposing offers that a leader would accept, but could not offer on her own. 
		  Mediators alter strategic bargaining in ways that allow a leader to learn credible information 
		  about her adversary, while improving the prospects for agreement. My article describes how this 
		  mechanism works and the implications for democracies at war, institutions, and the way we negotiate.

	<h3> Can we leverage observable attacks to reveal hidden motives? </h3>
	 
	         <p> Is Al Qaeda focused more on attacking the West, or on suppporting local campaigns of violence? 
			 To figure this out, we collected data on every affiliate in Al Qaeda's network, and constructed a 
			 classification scheme to differentiate affiliate conceptually and empirically. We  
			 used their targets and tactics to identify latent affiliate types, and track them over time. <br> <br> 
			 We find evidence of a global-parochial divide. A majority of Al Qaeda's affiliates are "parochial" -- focused on local targets and tactics. Fewer than 12% can 
			 be classified as focusing on the West. Further, targets and tactics aid in identifying latent types and tracking them over time.
		<br><br>

	<h3> Can we identify hierarchies in terrorist networks with minimal information? </h3>
	 	
	        <p> Due to the covert nature of terrorism, a group's leadership, cells, and structure are
			inherently difficult to identify. We theorize that the direction of terrorist communications
			can be used to reveal sets of mutual influence and a network's latent hierarchical structure. 
			In analyzing the 9/11 hijacker network and a larger network of 
			62 terrorists, we find that our method helps reveal hierarchies, leaders, and types of
		 	terrorist operatives.

	<h3> Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Violence in the Isreali-Palestinian Conflict </h3>
	        <p> When one thinks about violence in the I-P conflict, one often thinks of groups like Hamas. 
			However, some of that violence is also perpetrated by unorganized civilians. 
			Further, violence has excitation effects, where violence tends to beget more violence, 
			but this might depend on who perpetrated that violence. 
			<br> <br> I examine micro-level data on attacks ranging from stone throwing to rockets
			reported in  
			<a target="_blank" href="http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/en/21126/">weekly reports.</a>
			I find that significant differences in the 
			spatial and temporal patterns of organized and unorganized violence using a multidimensional hawkes 
			process model to account for temporal and spatial excitation effects as well as factors 
			such as severity and weapon type.

          <h3>International Diplomacy Project</h3>
          <p> I am collecting data using student-powered simulations to explore how multilateral negotiations and diplomacy works. The simulations have been run annually since 2013, and has expanded to include participants from Georgia Tech, Morehouse College, Spelman College, Agnes Scott, and Kennesaw State University.    
<br><br>
As a research endeavor, I designed the project to use real world data, new technology to track participants (RFID tokens), and social media to track dialogue. This research takes the first step in identifying the value of face-time, secrecy, mediation, and bilateral talks in simulating diplomacy. <br><br> Additional resources can be found here: <a href="idp.html"><strong>Project Website</strong></a>.</p>
