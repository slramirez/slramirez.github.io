<p> My research combines game theory with statistical methods, experiments, surveys, and field work to advance studies of crisis bargaining, leaders, and terrorism. </p>

	       <q> Is Al Qaeda focused on attacking the West, or supporting local terror? <br>		       
		       We collected data on Al Qaeda's network, classified affiliates using targets and tactics, and then tracked their types over time. 
		       <br> We show that: <br>
	      		1. Targets and tactics aid in identifying latent types.<br>
	      		2. There is a global-parochial divide within Al Qaeda. <br> 
			3. Over 85% of Al Qaeda's affiliates are parochial terrorists with locally-focused targets and tactics.

          <h3>International Diplomacy Project</h3>
          <p> I am collecting data using student-powered simulations to explore how multilateral negotiations and diplomacy works. The simulations have been run annually since 2013, and has expanded to include participants from Georgia Tech, Morehouse College, Spelman College, Agnes Scott, and Kennesaw State University.    
<br><br>
As a research endeavor, I designed the project to use real world data, new technology to track participants (RFID tokens), and social media to track dialogue. This research takes the first step in identifying the value of face-time, secrecy, mediation, and bilateral talks in simulating diplomacy. <br><br> Additional resources can be found here: <a href="idp.html"><strong>Project Website</strong></a>.</p>
